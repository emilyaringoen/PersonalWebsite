        <h2>Goals for the Future</h2>
        <p>A year ago, a friend suggested I take a look at Free Code Camp. I started going through the lessons and quickly grew to love coding. After completing my first project, I knew that I wanted to pursue web development as a career. After hours of
            researching, I decided to attend Galvanize's immersive program.</p>
        <p>I am psyched to start on January 30th (the pizza and pear on the right show how I am feeling about this)! I know this course will be challenging, but I hope to come out with a foundation of skills that can be applied to my first job in the tech
            industry.</p>
        <p>After graduating, I want to find a job as a junior developer here in Boulder, CO. Web development is an intriguing field, as it combines creativity with science. I hope to continue to learn, grow and create--and I will to try my best to find a
            job that challenges me to do just that.</p>
